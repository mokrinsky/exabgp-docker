### Docker container for exabgp

This is the repository mirror of CI script for gitlab-ci that builds container image for [exabgp](https://github.com/Exa-Networks/exabgp).
Originally this is built in private environment without internet access, so all the lines mentioning proxy could be easily removed.
Also originally it uses modified [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) image, but it should work fine with the default as well.
